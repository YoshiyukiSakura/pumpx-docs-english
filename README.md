# Welcome to PumpX

## Why did we build PumpX?

The market already has various products like Gmgn, Dexscreener, Pepeboost, and DEXX, covering Web, Telegram, and App platforms. So why did we build PumpX? Here are the key reasons:

* **Empowering "Information + Trading" with AI**. Products like Gmgn, Pepeboost, and Dexscreener function more as "tools," addressing only specific user needs without offering a streamlined, user-friendly "application" for the broader consumer market. These tools fail to solve the full cycle from "Meme information discovery" → "Meme information flow" → "Meme trading." PumpX leverages AI to aggregate and analyze on-chain and off-chain data, generating actionable trading strategies to enhance trading certainty for users.
* **Unmatched Security.** Litentry, a Binance-listed project ([https://www.litentry.com](https://www.litentry.com/)), brings years of expertise in security and privacy. PumpX builds its account system and asset management modules on Litentry’s foundation, utilizing advanced cryptographic technologies like TEE (Trusted Execution Environment) and SMPC (Secure Multi-Party Computation) clusters to ensure the highest level of security. While maintaining transaction speed, we optimize risk control and security measures. We have successfully passed the [SlowMist audit](https://3820447269-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FTaG6KeHpkB3eqdZnqflw%2Fuploads%2FLXLjZIzX3Mt47MY1IJcv%2FPumpX-SlowMist%20Audit%20Report.pdf?alt=media\&token=e589f76a-ef9b-4eaa-a96c-50462f044ce4), our proprietary trading system and 2FA authentication effectively reduce phishing and account suspension risks, ensuring the safety of user funds.
* **Community First**. PumpX emphasizes a strong community culture, enabling users to co-create and actively shape the product. Feedback from users is addressed promptly and effectively, reinforcing our belief that the community is the ultimate Alpha.

The following picture illustrates PumpX’s mission and how it stands apart from many existing DEX products.
