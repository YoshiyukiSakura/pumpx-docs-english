# Compliance with FCA

### 1. Overview

This document outlines how PumpX mobile app complies with the FCA’s policy on crypto asset promotions in relation to the trading functionalities provided via our platform. Our platform implements third-party exchange APIs, specifically Raydium’s API (https://docs.raydium.io/raydium/traders/trade-api), to facilitate token swaps. It is critical to note that we are not a crypto exchange service. Rather, we operate as an on-chain trading tool focused on enhancing user experience. Raydium is a decentralized, on-chain protocol on the Solana blockchain.

### 2. Nature of Our Services

Our platform:

* Does not hold or manage user funds: All trades occur directly on-chain, ensuring users maintain custody of their assets at all times.&#x20;
* Does not facilitate fiat-to-crypto or crypto-to-fiat transactions: Our tool is designed exclusively for token swaps and related on-chain activities.
* Is an on-chain tool: Users interact directly with decentralized protocols through their own wallets.

Our services are strictly limited to improving the user experience for interacting with decentralized exchanges, without providing custodial or centralized exchange functions.

### 3. Compliance Measures

3.1. Clear and Non-Misleading Communications

* Transparency: All marketing and promotional materials are clear, fair, and not misleading. We explicitly state that we are a decentralized on-chain trading tool and not a crypto exchange.
* Risk Disclosures: We prominently disclose the risks associated with token swaps and decentralized finance, including market volatility, potential loss of funds, and technological risks.

Our platform complies with the FCA’s regulations by:

* Ensuring that promotional content is written in plain language, with no technical jargon that could mislead users.
* Including risk warnings in a prominent position in all communications.
* Providing accurate descriptions of our services, emphasizing our role as a non-custodial, decentralized tool.

3.3. No Investment Advice

We do not provide investment advice or recommend any trading strategies. All decisions made by users are their own responsibility.

3.4. KYC/AML Policies

While we do not manage user funds or perform custodial functions, we encourage our users to adhere to the laws and regulations of their respective jurisdictions. Users interact directly with the decentralized Raydium protocol, which operates within the transparent and auditable Solana blockchain ecosystem.

### 4. User Safeguards

* Educational Materials: We provide educational resources to help users understand the risks and benefits of interacting with decentralized protocols.
* Non-Custodial Architecture: Users retain full control over their assets, as all transactions are executed directly through their connected wallets.
* Risk Warnings: Clear and prominent warnings regarding potential losses and market volatility are provided throughout the user journey.
