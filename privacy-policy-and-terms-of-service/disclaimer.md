PumpX does not provide, own, or control the Third-Party Exchange Services or any transactions conducted on or through those services. By using the App, you acknowledge and agree that any transactions or interactions facilitated via the App are conducted directly with the underlying Third-Party Exchange Services, at your own risk, and PumpX shall not be held liable for any claims, damages, or losses arising therefrom.
