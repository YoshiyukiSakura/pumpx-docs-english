#### PumpX Software

"PumpX" refers to open-source software deployed on the Ethereum, Solana, Base, Binance Smart Chain, Tron, Sui, and TON blockchains, facilitating peer-to-peer exchanges of tokens on these blockchains.

The primary purpose of this Website is to provide users with access to the PumpX software products and related resources, including but not limited to developer documentation, product examples, and other relevant services (collectively referred to as "Services").

"PumpX" encompasses all users, companies, applications, and other participants who interact directly or indirectly with the Ethereum, Solana, or Base blockchains.

Some services provided by us or other participants may require payments or involve the use of underlying blockchain or other distributed or permissioned infrastructure (collectively "Distributed Ledger Technology"). These may involve fees such as "gas" fees on the Ethereum network or other charges required for transactions on distributed ledger technologies. You acknowledge and agree that PumpX cannot control distributed ledger technology transactions, the payment method for any fees, or the actual payment of any fees. Therefore, you must ensure that your distributed ledger technology-compatible wallet has a sufficient balance of applicable tokens to complete any transaction on the PumpX application or distributed ledger technology.

As a condition of accessing or using the website or service, you must not: (i) violate any applicable laws, including but not limited to any relevant and applicable anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism financing laws, as well as any relevant and applicable privacy and data collection laws (which may be amended from time to time); (ii) violate applicable export laws or regulations, or directly or indirectly export, re-export, or transfer any PumpX technology; (iii) infringe upon or misappropriate any contract, intellectual property, or other third-party rights, or engage in any infringing activities while using the website or service; (iv) misrepresent the truth, source, or reliability of any content provided on the website or through the service; (v) use the website or service in any way that disrupts, interferes with, negatively impacts, or prevents other users from fully enjoying the website, service, or PumpX network, or damages, disables, overburdens, or impairs the operation of the website, service, or PumpX network; (vi) attempt to circumvent any content filtering technology or security measures used by PumpX on the website or service, or attempt to access any service or area of the website or service to which you are not authorized; (vii) use any bots, spiders, crawlers, scraping tools, or other automated means or interfaces not provided by us to access the website or service or extract data; (viii) introduce any malware, viruses, trojans, worms, logic bombs, crash devices, backdoors, shutdown mechanisms, or other harmful materials into the website or service; (ix) post content on the website or through the service that we, at our discretion, consider defamatory, libelous, obscene, pornographic, explicit, obscene, vulgar, suggestive, harassing, hateful, threatening, offensive, discriminatory, paranoid, abusive, inciting, fraudulent, deceptive, or otherwise objectionable; (x) post content on the website or through the service that contains unsolicited promotional, political campaign, or commercial information, or any chain messages or user content designed to deceive or trick service users; or (xi) encourage or induce any third party to engage in any activity prohibited by these terms.

* **Privacy Policy**: Please refer to our Privacy Policy to understand how we collect, use, share, and otherwise process your information.
* **Service Modification and Suspension**: We reserve the right to modify, suspend, or permanently disable all or part of the services provided by PumpX, at our sole discretion, at any time and for any reason (including, but not limited to, security incidents), with or without prior notice to you.

We are not liable for any loss you may suffer due to any modification of the services or any suspension or termination of your access to all or part of the website or services for any reason.

Regardless of the reason for the expiration or termination, all of these terms shall remain in effect after you terminate your access to the website or services, except for any provisions that, by their nature, should continue to apply under the law.

**Electronic Notifications:** You agree to receive all communications, agreements, documents, receipts, notices, and disclosures (collectively referred to as "Our Communications") related to these Terms or any services in electronic form. You agree that we may provide Our Communications to you by posting them on the website, through the services, or by sending them to the email address you provided when using the services. You are responsible for retaining copies of Our Communications by printing paper copies or saving electronic copies. You may also contact our support team by submitting a support request to team@pumpx.ai to request additional electronic copies of Our Communications.

**Indemnification:** You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless PumpX, our affiliates, and each of our affiliates' respective shareholders, members, directors, officers, employees, attorneys, agents, representatives, suppliers, licensors, and contractors (collectively, the "Protected Parties") from and against any claims, demands, lawsuits, actions, proceedings, investigations, liabilities, damages, losses, costs, or expenses (including, but not limited to, reasonable attorney's fees) arising from your use or actions related to the website, services, any distributed ledger technology assets associated with your distributed ledger technology address, any other digital assets, any feedback or your content; your violation of these Terms; your violation of applicable laws or regulations; or your infringement or misappropriation of any third-party rights. If you are required to indemnify any Protected Party, PumpX (or the applicable Protected Party, at its discretion) will have the right to control any actions or proceedings and determine whether PumpX wishes to settle, and if so, under what terms.

**Disclaimer:** PumpX is primarily an open-source software developer. PumpX does not operate virtual currency or derivative trading platforms and does not provide trading execution or clearing services. Therefore, we cannot supervise, participate in, or control your transactions, including the purchase and sale of existing or future tokens.

You are responsible for complying with all laws and regulations applicable to your transactions, including but not limited to the Commodity Exchange Act and regulations promulgated by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission ("CFTC") under that Act, the Bank Secrecy Act and regulations promulgated by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network ("FinCEN") under that Act, as well as federal securities laws and regulations promulgated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") under those laws.

You acknowledge that PumpX is not registered or licensed with the CFTC, SEC, FinCEN, or any financial regulatory authority. No financial regulatory authority has reviewed or approved the use of PumpX's open-source software or services. This website and services do not constitute advice or recommendations regarding any commodities, securities, or other assets. PumpX is not acting as an investment advisor or commodity trading advisor for any individual.

PumpX cannot modify or control the underlying code of the smart contracts in any way. The ability to modify PumpX smart contracts is managed by a multi-signature wallet currently controlled by PumpX, with further details provided here. Generally speaking, the underlying protocols are open-source, and anyone can use, copy, modify, and distribute them. PumpX is not responsible for the operation of underlying protocols such as Ethereum, and does not guarantee their functionality, security, or availability.

To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, the website and services (and any content or features thereof) provided by us or on our behalf are offered on an "as is" and "as available" basis. We expressly disclaim, and you hereby waive, any representations, conditions, or warranties, whether express or implied, statutory, or otherwise, arising from regulations, laws, course of dealing, or trade practices, including but not limited to implied warranties or conditions of merchantability, quality, fitness for a particular purpose, title, security, availability, reliability, accuracy, quiet enjoyment, and non-infringement of third-party rights. Without limiting the foregoing, we do not make any representations or warranties that the website or services (including any related data) will be uninterrupted, available at any particular time, or error-free. Furthermore, we do not guarantee that any errors in the website or services will be corrected or can be corrected.

You acknowledge that, for various reasons, the data you obtain from the website or through the services may be irretrievably lost, damaged, or temporarily unavailable, and you agree that, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, we shall not be liable for any loss or damage caused by denial-of-service attacks, software failures, viruses, or other technically harmful materials (including those that may infect your computing devices), changes in third-party service provider agreements, internet disruptions, force majeure events, or other disasters, planned or unplanned maintenance, or any other causes within or beyond our control.

If the applicable law in your jurisdiction does not allow for the exclusion or limitation of such warranties, the disclaimer of implied warranties contained in these terms may not apply.

1. **Exclusion of Indirect and Related Damages:** Under no circumstances shall the company or any protected party be liable for any incidental, indirect, special, punitive, exemplary, or similar damages or liabilities (including but not limited to the loss of data, information, revenue, goodwill, profits, or other business or financial interests), whether such damages or liabilities arise from the website, services, and PumpX network (and its content and features), execution or settlement of transactions, performance or non-performance of services, your distributed ledger technology assets, other digital assets, or any other products, services, or items provided by a protected party or its representatives, whether based on contract, tort (including negligence), civil liability, regulations, strict liability, breach of warranty, or any other theory of liability. This applies even if any protected party has been advised, is aware of, or should have been aware of the possibility of such damages, and regardless of whether the failure of the terms or the basic purpose of these terms is considered. Any limited remedies also do not hold PumpX accountable in any way for the execution or settlement of transactions between users of the PumpX open-source software or the PumpX network.
2. **Limitation of Liability:** Under no circumstances shall the total liability of any protected party arising from the website, services, and PumpX network (and its content and features), performance or non-performance of services, your distributed ledger technology assets, other digital assets, or any other products, services, or items provided by a protected party or its representatives exceed the amount you paid to us under these terms within the twelve (12) months immediately preceding the event giving rise to the liability claim, regardless of whether the claim arises under contract, tort (including negligence), civil liability, regulations, strict liability, or any other theory of liability.
3. **Disclaimer:** To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, in consideration for being permitted to use this website, services, and/or the PumpX network, you hereby release and forever discharge the company and all protected parties from any and all claims, disputes, controversies, demands, rights, obligations, liabilities, actions, and lawsuits (including personal injury, death, and property damage), regardless of the nature or kind, whether arising directly or indirectly from or in connection with the website, services, and/or PumpX network (including any interaction with other websites or PumpX network users or third-party services, or any actions or omissions), and you hereby waive and relinquish any provisions of applicable laws or regulations to the contrary, which essentially state: "A general release does not apply to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist at the time of signing the release, and which, if known, would have materially affected the creditor's decision to sign the release."
4.  **Dispute Resolution and Arbitration:** Please read the following section carefully, as it requires you to arbitrate certain disputes and claims with PumpX and limits the ways you can seek relief from us, unless you opt out of arbitration as outlined below. Furthermore, arbitration prohibits you from filing a lawsuit or seeking a jury trial in court.



You and PumpX agree that any dispute arising from or related to these Terms or our services is a personal matter between you and PumpX, and any dispute will be resolved solely through individual arbitration, and not through class arbitration, class action, or any other type of representative action.

You and PumpX agree that, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the enforceability of this Section 11 is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act ("FAA") in both substance and procedure. Under the FAA, these Terms, and the rules of the American Arbitration Association (AAA), the arbitrator will have exclusive authority to make all procedural and substantive decisions regarding any dispute, and to grant any remedies that would otherwise be available in a court of law, including the power to determine issues of arbitrability. The arbitrator can only conduct individual arbitration and cannot consolidate the claims of multiple individuals, nor preside over any type of class or representative action, or any lawsuit involving multiple individuals.

The arbitrator, PumpX, and you agree to maintain the confidentiality of all arbitration proceedings, judgments, and awards, including but not limited to all information collected, prepared, and submitted for the purposes of arbitration or related to the dispute. Unless otherwise required by law, the arbitrator will have the authority to make appropriate rulings to protect confidentiality. The confidentiality obligation does not apply if disclosure is necessary for preparing or conducting a substantive arbitration hearing, applying for preliminary relief in court, or challenging the arbitration award or its enforcement in court, or if required by law or judicial order.

You and PumpX agree that, for any arbitration initiated by you, you will pay the filing fees, and PumpX will pay the remaining AAA fees and costs. For any arbitration initiated by PumpX, PumpX will pay all AAA fees and costs. You and PumpX further agree that the courts of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region have exclusive jurisdiction over any appeals and the enforcement of arbitration awards.

Any claim arising out of or related to these Terms or our services must be made within one year of the claim arising; otherwise, the claim will be permanently barred, meaning neither you nor PumpX will have the right to pursue such a claim.

You have the right to opt out of binding arbitration within 30 days from the date of first accepting these Terms by sending an email to team@pumpx.ai. To be effective, the opt-out notice must include your full name and address, and clearly indicate your intention to opt out of binding arbitration. By opting out of binding arbitration, you agree to resolve disputes under Section 11.

If any part of Section 11 is found to be unenforceable or illegal for any reason, the unenforceable or illegal provision will be severed from these Terms, and the severed provision will not affect the enforceability of the remaining provisions of Section 11 or either party's ability to arbitrate any remaining claims on an individual basis. If any claim must therefore be pursued in a collective, class, consolidated, or representative manner, such claims must be litigated in a civil court with appropriate jurisdiction rather than in arbitration, and both parties agree that litigation of such claims will continue in court until the outcome of any individual claims in arbitration. Additionally, if any part of Section 11 is found to prohibit seeking public injunctive relief in individual claims, that provision will not affect the ability to seek such relief through arbitration to the extent permitted, and the remaining portions of Section 11 will remain enforceable.

**Applicable Law:** The interpretation and enforcement of these Terms, as well as any disputes related to these Terms, the website, or services, will be governed by the laws of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, without regard to the principles or rules that would result in the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction. You agree that we may initiate litigation in any court of competent jurisdiction related to the enforcement or validity of our intellectual property. For any other litigation not subject to arbitration under these Terms, the courts located in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region will have exclusive jurisdiction. You waive any objections to the venue of such courts.

**Miscellaneous:** Any rights or remedies of PumpX under these Terms are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights or remedies provided by law, equity, or other legal provisions. Our failure or delay in exercising any rights, powers, or privileges under these Terms does not constitute a waiver of such rights. The invalidity or un-enforceability of any provision of these Terms will not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision, and all provisions will remain fully effective.

We are not responsible for any failure or delay in the performance of the website or any services, or for any loss or damage you may suffer, due to circumstances or events beyond our control, including but not limited to floods, extreme weather conditions, earthquakes or other natural disasters, fires, wars, riots, strikes, accidents, government actions, communication failures, power outages, or equipment or software failures.

You may not assign or transfer any rights to use the website or services, or any rights or obligations you have under these Terms, without our prior written consent, including transfers or assignments due to changes in control. We may assign or transfer any or all of our rights or obligations under these Terms in whole or in part, without notice or consent from you.

The section titles are for convenience only and will not be used to limit or interpret such sections. These Terms constitute the entire agreement and supersede all prior and contemporaneous understandings between the parties regarding the website and services. In the event of a conflict between these Terms and any other agreement between you and us, these Terms shall prevail unless the other agreement explicitly states that it supersedes these Terms.

**Statement:** PumpX reserves the right to modify and update these Terms of Service at any time. Any modified terms will take effect immediately upon notice being posted and will apply to all users.
