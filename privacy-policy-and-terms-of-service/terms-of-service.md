### **PumpX Software**

"PumpX" refers to open-source software developed by Trust Computing GmbH and deployed on various blockchain platforms, including Ethereum, Solana, Base, Binance Smart Chain, Tron, Sui, and TON. The primary purpose of this Website is to provide users with access to the PumpX software products and related resources, including but not limited to developer documentation, product examples, and other relevant services (collectively referred to as "Services").

"PumpX" encompasses all users, companies, applications, and other participants who interact directly or indirectly with the Ethereum, Solana, or Base blockchains.

Some services provided by us or other participants may require payments or involve the use of underlying blockchain or other distributed or permissioned infrastructure (collectively "Distributed Ledger Technology"). These may involve fees such as "gas" fees on the Ethereum network or other charges required for transactions on distributed ledger technologies. You acknowledge and agree that PumpX cannot control distributed ledger technology transactions, the payment method for any fees, or the actual payment of any fees. Therefore, you must ensure that your distributed ledger technology-compatible wallet has a sufficient balance of applicable tokens to complete any transaction on the PumpX application or distributed ledger technology.
