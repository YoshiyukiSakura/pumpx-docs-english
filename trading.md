# Trading

PumpX currently supports four types of trading modes: **One-Click**, **Market Order**, **Limit Order**, and **Trailing Stop**.

1. **One-Click:** We provide six preset price levels for users to quickly execute trades. Additionally, in **One-Click Buy** mode, users can enable the **"Double Your Investment"** feature, which allows them to protect their original fund while aiming for higher returns in Meme trading.
2. **Market Order:** This mode allows users to buy or sell tokens at the latest market price. (Note: Due to price fluctuations and factors such as liquidity, the price you see may differ from the actual trade price within your set slippage range.)
3. **Limit Order:** Users can trade tokens using one of three methods: by **Market Capitalization**, **Price**, or **Percentage**, offering flexibility in how trades are executed.
4. **Trailing Stop:** This feature enables users to set a callback percentage to track the token's market price for profits and loss prevention. When the price reaches the predefined level, a market order is automatically triggered. This helps users protect long-term profits, safeguard capital during volatility, and move the stop-loss point as the market rises.
