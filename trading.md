# Trading

PumpX currently supports four types of trading modes: **One-Click Buy**, **Market Orders**, **Limit Orders**, and 移动止盈止损.

1. **One-Click Buy:** We provide six preset price levels for users to quickly execute trades. Additionally, in **One-Click Buy** mode, users can enable the **"Double Your Investment"** feature, which allows them to protect their original fund while aiming for higher returns in Meme trading.
2. **Market Orders:** This mode allows users to buy or sell tokens at the latest market price. (Note: Due to price fluctuations and factors such as liquidity, the price you see may differ from the actual trade price within your set slippage range.)
3. **Limit Orders:** Users can trade tokens using one of three methods: by **Market Capitalization**, **Price**, or **Percentage**, offering flexibility in how trades are executed.
4. 移动止盈止&#x635F;**:** This feature enables users to set a callback percentage to track the token's market price for profits and loss prevention. When the price reaches the predefined level, a market order is automatically triggered. This helps users secure long-term gains, safeguard assets during periods of volatility, 并在上升趋势中调整止损.
