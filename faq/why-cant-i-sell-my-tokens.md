# Why Can't I Sell My Tokens?

There are several potential reasons for a failed transaction. The most common issues include insufficient gas fees, low liquidity, low slippage settings, honeypot tokens, or network-related problems. For example:

* If the gas fee was $16 a second ago, but your balance is only $20 and the gas fee suddenly rises to $22, you will receive a transaction failure notification.
* Low liquidity means there aren’t enough tokens in the liquidity pool to meet the sell demand. In other words, there may not be enough buyers or funds to support your sell order, or the available funds may not be sufficient for your trade.
* Low slippage often becomes an issue with high-volume tokens. When large buy or sell orders enter the market simultaneously, they can significantly alter the token’s price. If your slippage setting is too low, the price may exceed your acceptable range by the time you submit the transaction, resulting in a failure.
* You may be trying to sell a honeypot token that has been blacklisted, or the token may have specific rules in place that prevent its sale.
