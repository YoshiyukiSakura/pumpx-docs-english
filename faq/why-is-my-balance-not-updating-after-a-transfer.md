# Why Is My Balance Not Updating After a Transfer?

PumpX relies on both official and third-party nodes to process transactions. Occasionally, due to blockchain congestion, network issues, or instability with third-party services, you may see that a transaction is marked as completed on the blockchain but notice that your balance hasn't updated immediately in the app.

**Note:** This is not an issue unique to PumpX—many leading exchanges and other trading platforms experience similar delays. The blockchain record remains the most reliable source of information. If the transaction appears on the blockchain, it means the asset has successfully reached your wallet, even if it hasn’t yet been reflected in the app.
