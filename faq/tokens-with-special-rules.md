# Tokens with Special Rules

\
Certain tokens have specific rules that may affect transactions. These include:

* **Buy/Sell Restrictions:** Some tokens impose limits on the number of buy or sell transactions allowed within the same block.
* **Blacklist Smart Contracts:** These can prevent specific addresses from transferring or selling tokens.
* **Transaction Tax:** Some tokens apply a transaction tax on each trade. These taxes may be used for various purposes, such as token burning, rewarding holders, providing liquidity, or supporting project development. There is no upper limit for these taxes; some tokens may set high tax rates to maintain liquidity.
* **Decimal Limitations:** Some tokens allow purchases or sales only in whole numbers or impose restrictions on the number of decimal places.
* **Balance Modifications:** Some tokens may allow the contract code to directly modify a user's token balance.

These are just some common examples of special rules. As blockchain technology continues to evolve, new rules will emerge. Please **DYOR**! Carefully assess the risks before making any investments. PumpX is not responsible for any losses caused by these special rules.
