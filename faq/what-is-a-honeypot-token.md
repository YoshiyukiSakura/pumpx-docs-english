# What is a Honeypot token?

Honeypot tokens are maliciously designed to entice users into making trades and then steal their funds. In a honeypot scam, the malicious contract appears legitimate and often enlists various Key Opinion Leaders (KOLs) or community leaders to encourage investors to buy in. Initially, investors may even see some profits. However, when they attempt to sell or transfer the tokens, they discover that the contract blocks the transaction. This allows scammers to steal users' funds, leaving them unable to recover their losses.
