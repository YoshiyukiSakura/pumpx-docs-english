# Application Risk Warning

Some Android operating systems, particularly Huawei's HarmonyOS, have strict regulations regarding crypto. If the system detects the term "crypto," it may flag the app as potentially malicious. However, if you download the APK from the official website [https://www.pumpx.ai](https://www.pumpx.ai), it is completely safe.

On certain Huawei devices, you may need to disable "Pure Mode" or disconnect from the internet to proceed with the installation.

For your security, do not click on or install APK files sent to you by others.
