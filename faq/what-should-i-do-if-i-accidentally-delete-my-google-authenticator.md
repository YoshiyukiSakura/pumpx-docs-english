# What Should I Do If I Accidentally Delete My Google Authenticator?

Your Google Authenticator is as crucial as your private key. It is required, along with email verification, for sensitive operations such as exporting your private key, transferring funds, or changing your login password. If you lose access to your Google Authenticator and have not saved your private key, unfortunately, you will not be able to regain access to your PumpX account.

Since PumpX is a decentralized application, we are unable to assist with account recovery or unlinking your account.
