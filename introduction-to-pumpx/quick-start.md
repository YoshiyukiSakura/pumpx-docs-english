On the Deposit page, you will find a QR code and a Solana wallet address. Below is a step-by-step guide on how to transfer funds to your PumpX wallet using Binance as an example (other exchanges follow a similar process).

4. Step 3:
   * Paste the PumpX deposit address (found on your PumpX deposit page) into the recipient address field.
   * Select the Solana network as the withdrawal network.
   * Enter the amount of SOL you wish to transfer.
5. Step 4: After verifying the details, click "Withdraw" and wait for the Solana network to process your transaction.
6. Completion: Once the transfer is confirmed, your SOL balance will appear in the PumpX assets page.

Now that you have SOL in your PumpX wallet, youâ€™re ready to start trading!

### 4. Trading

PumpX currently supports three main trading scenarios:

1. Leaderboard-Based Trading
   * The home page features a leaderboard showcasing the top-performing tokens based on price changes over different time periods. This effectively highlights the most actively traded tokens on the network.
2. AI-Powered Token Recommendations
   * The central PumpX section offers AI-driven token recommendations, leveraging multiple signals such as token price and volume (K-line data), market trend analysis, and smart money activity.
   * There are two AI recommendation models, each with a different focus:
     * "AI Agent" (Left Panel): Prioritizes smart money insights and token price-volume trends.
     * "X News" (Right Panel): Focuses on market trends based on real-time social sentiment.
   * The AI Agent further distinguishes between two strategies:
     1. Aggressive Mode: Aimed at maximizing potential returns with higher-risk trades.
     2. Conservative Mode: Focused on capital preservation while still generating returns.
   * The X News section highlights trending token-related discussions, displaying:
     * The accountâ€™s follower count (including notable followers).
     * The number of tweets and whether the account has undergone name changesâ€”helping users assess credibility.
